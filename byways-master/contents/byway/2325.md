Love nature? Then take the Great Divide National Scenic Highway
through the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest and revel in the
wonderful diversity of plant and animal life in the majestic
Northwoods. The byway passes through forests harboring black bear,
timber wolves and white-tailed deer. It crosses lakes, swamps and
bogs alive with beaver, loons and bald eagles. Lakes and rivers are
also abundant in the area, providing more scenery to capture on
film. If the weather is not to your taste or the wildlife proves
elusive, spend some time with nature of a different sort at the
National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame, a not-to-miss attraction
in the area.

Some of the most beautiful scenery in Northern Wisconsin occurs
during the fall foliage season, when the fiery reds and shimmering
golds of the sugar maples and red maples contrast against the deep
greens of pine and fir to the delight of travelers.
