The Crawford Lakelands Scenic Byway is a double loop driving tour of two lakes: Conneaut, a natural glacial lake; and Pymatuning, the largest manmade lake in all of Pennsylvania. Travel through Pymatuning State Park, encompassing 21,122 acres of land and 17,088 acres of water, four public beaches, and three marina concessions. Named by Seneca American Indians as Kon-ne-ot, meaning *Snow Waters*, Conneaut Lake is rich in Native American and Early American history.  The Conneaut Lake Historical Society includes displays of geological details that created the lake, Indian artifacts and fossils of both the Wooly Mammoths and mastodons, and a rich and diverse collection of the history of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s largest natural lake.
