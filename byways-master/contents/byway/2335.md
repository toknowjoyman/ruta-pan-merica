<p>This 35-mile Scenic Byway begins in the Downtown Millen Historic District, with its railroad depots dating from the early 1990s and the Millen-Jenkins County Museum, featuring local histories, Native American artifacts, tools, and cotton mill equipment. Proceeding to SR 23 and Perkins Green Fork Road, visitors can get a sense of scenic character by passing through woodlands, pasture lands, and historic farmhouses that dot the small and scattered communities. Varied and distinctive viewsheds are found on Herndon Road, along with several historic churches. The SR 17 heading back to Cotton Avenue is characterized simply by wide-open farmland stretching for miles.</p>

<p>Magnolia Springs State Park is located 3 miles from the
intersection of SR 17 and US 25, and features crystal clear
springs, hiking/biking trails, and the Historic Fort Lawton, an
1864 prisoner-of-war camp. The Fort Lawton Historic Trail and the Bo Ginn Aquarium are also found in the park.</p>
