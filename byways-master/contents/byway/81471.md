The byway offers opportunities for visitors to enjoy a variety of experiences and “get their own kicks” while driving the original Kansas portion of Route 66, found in the “Ozark Plateau” or southeast corner of the state. Museums, murals and ghost writing found along the way tell the local history of life along the route. A traveler can drive over many of the original structures of “The Mother Road,” including the only remaining Marsh Arch Bridge on Route 66, and even explore the mining and railroad history of the area.
  
Visitors can have a picture taken with the tow truck that was the inspiration for the character “Mater” from the “Cars” movies or discover Schermerhorn Park and the
Southeast Kansas Nature Center south of Galena. Travelers can also learn about the importance of hydroelectricity in Riverton or enjoy a stop at the Eisler’s Brother Store, the location of a 1920’s Route 66 gas station. The stories of Baxter Springs, another town along the route, include those from Native American history and early battles of the Civil War. There are tours offered throughout the year, a variety of dining and lodging facilities available, and even locations that offer a chance to purchase Route 66 memorabilia.
