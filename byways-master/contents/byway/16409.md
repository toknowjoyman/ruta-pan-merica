<p>This 13.7 mile scenic loop within the Theodore Roosevelt
National Park gives access to superb camping, backpacking,
birdwatching, hiking, and horseback riding. You can drink in
exhilarating vistas from the Riverbend Overlook, which is a short
walk from a parking lot. You can also canoe and kayak the Little
Missouri, which follows the route.<br>
<br>
This park was named after President Roosevelt because he attributed
much of his political motivation to the experiences he had in North
Dakota parks.<br>
<br>
Regarding Roosevelt and this park, the National Park Service site
says, "Here in the North Dakota badlands, where many of his
personal concerns first gave rise to his later environmental
efforts, Roosevelt is remembered with a national park that bears
his name and honors the memory of this great conservationist.
Theodore Roosevelt National Park is in the colorful North Dakota
badlands and is home to a variety of plants animals, including
bison, prairie dogs, and elk."<br></p>
