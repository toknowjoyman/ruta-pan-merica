description: "Named for Revolutionary War General Andrew Pickens, the Andrew Pickens Scenic Byway lies near the site of Pickens' last battle against the Cherokee Indians, commonly known as the Ring Fight. Outnumbered more than seven to one, Pickens and his men managed to defeat the Indians. Pickens built his final home, the Red House, about a mile away from the site of the battle. In later years, the Indians  came to revere Pickens, calling him <em>Skyagusta</em>, or \"wizard owl.\""
