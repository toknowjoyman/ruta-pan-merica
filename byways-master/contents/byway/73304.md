The Stars and Stripes Byway runs 5.5 miles on state highway 25 in Stoddard County from the northern city limits of Bloomfield southward the Stars and Stripes Museum and Veteran’s Cemetery.   

Citizens in Stoddard County have worked to bring a number of historical and cultural institutions into public view and public patronage.  Several of these are located within minutes of the Miller House, the Stoddard County Archives and its locally significant collections, including Civil War era records, the Civil War era cemetery, the Stars and Stripes Museum, and the Missouri Veterans’ cemetery, which recognizes our citizens preparation and devotion to our collective democratic heritage.  The Miller House offers a domestic site on a spacious lot to complement what has already been accomplished and to offer a close look for interpretation of an artifact and lifeways that were once common in Southeast Missouri.
