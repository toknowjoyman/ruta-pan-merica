Chan SanSan Scenic Backway, formerly known as the James
River Valley Scenic Byway and Backway, takes travelers through a valley carved out over 12,000 years ago by glacial melt water.
Rich in history, the name Chan SanSan is the Yanktonai Sioux
name for the James River. Travelers today will find the rich
history of those early people along with scenic beauty and
multiple opportunities for recreation and wildlife viewing.
