<p>The Ocmulgee-Piedmont Scenic Byway traverses 200 years of Jones
County history as well as the pre-historic and historic sites of
the Creek Indians that lived there in the 17th and 18th Centuries.
What is now SR 11 was formerly an Indian trail and a major
north-south route between Hillsboro in Jasper County and Clinton,
Jones County's 19th century county seat.</p>
<p>In 1864, during the Civil War, opposing forces met along this
road at the Battle of Sunshine Church and later that year General
Sherman followed this route through Jones County on his "March to
the Sea."</p>
<p>The Round Oak-Juliette Road portion of the byway was originally
an Indian trail and now travels through the pristine pine forests
of the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge, which is inhabited by
several species of endangered wildlife. East Juliette, the endpoint
of the byway, is a small late 19th/early 20th Century mill village
community located on the Ocmulgee River.</p>
<p>Features of this byway include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge- 35,000 acres, includes the
scenic Little Rock Wildlife Drive, a six-mile tour taking visitors
through a variety of landscapes and canopies. Fishing, hunting,
hiking.</li>
<li>Jarrell Plantation (off of Round Oak-Juliette Road)- a State
Historic Site with 20 buildings dating from 1847 to 1940, including
a plain-style plantation house, saw mill, cotton gin, grist mill,
and blacksmith shop.</li>
<li>Ocmulgee River- provides seasonal recreational opportunities
such as fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and motorboating. Just over
the river in the City of Juliette is the central setting for the
1991 film <cite>Fried Green Tomatoes.</cite></li>
</ul>
