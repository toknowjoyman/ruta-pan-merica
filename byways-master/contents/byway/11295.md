<p>The Jerome, Clarkdale, Cottonwood Historic Road was designated on May 13, 1992, by the Arizona Department of Transportation. The Tuzigoot National Monument which can be seen over looking the Verde River from the road, was the site of a Sinagua village between 1125 and 1400. Prior to the Sinagua, the Hohokam were known to live in the area. Several of the towns along the road are on the National Register of Historic sites, including Jerome and Clarkdale. The distinct combination of visual patterns in the historic sites, riparian vegetation, mines, ancient Indian dwellings and the Black Hills/Mingus Mountain make this drive a memorable experience.</p>
