The Pensacola Bluffs Scenic Highway exemplifies a historic, natural, recreational and scenic trip through an area of Pensacola and Escambia County noted for its significant resources. From the southernmost terminus where moss-draped oaks and stately magnolias surround the bridge over Bayou Texar, travelers drive atop the unique bluffs which provide scenic vistas of Escambia Bay and represent the highest point along the entire coastline of Florida.  The corridor continues through wetlands supporting a diversity of flora and fauna toward its northern terminus in tidal wetlands where U.S. 90 bridges the Escambia River.
