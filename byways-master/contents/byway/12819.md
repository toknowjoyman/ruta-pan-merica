<h4>On a Backroad</h4>
<p>As a remote byway in the North Carolina piedmont, this drive is
for the adventurous traveler. Take a trip on this byway on your way
to a camping vacation in the Uwharrie National Forest or drive it
en route to the cities of central North Carolina. Wherever your
destination is, the Flint Hill Ramble is a ramble you'll want to
try.</p>
<h4>Places to Stop</h4>
<p>This byway travels through the Uwharrie National Forest, past
the site of Jumping Off Rock-- a rocky bluff over looking cool
waters. Definitely a temptation for travelers on a hot summer day,
but jumping of this aptly named rock is discouraged. Travelers will
continue on through the town of Ophir, once a boom town during gold
mining days. Folklore of North Carolina's gold mining days can be
found among ruins of old mines near the Uwharrie River.</p>
<h4>Out of the Car</h4>
<p>Surrounded by the wilderness and the forest, outdoor lovers will
be refreshed by the opportunities to get out of the car and go for
a hike. The head of the Uwharrie Trail can be found along the byway
and will take hikers on a gorgeous hike through Uwharrie back
country. Nearby the Ramble, travelers will find Badin Lake and a
recreational area that invites boating, hiking, picnicking, and
camping.</p>
