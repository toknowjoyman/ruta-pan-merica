Travel through the center of the state into an area with a
legend. Old-timers would tell of an unusual clearing somewhere within the back country area with a circular path worn into the ground. The legend claims that this was the place where the devil would plot his mischief. To this day, the location of the "stompin' ground" of the devil remains known only to the local residents.

This colorful legend isn't the only attraction to the byway. The area is also filled with several other sites including historical spots and a state park. Jordan Lake State Park is only a few miles east of the byway while North Carolina Zoological Park is to the west. Wherever your interests may lie, you may find what you are looking for somewhere in the Devil's Stompin' Ground.
