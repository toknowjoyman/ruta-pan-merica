The Blackwoods Byway lies in the "Downeast" section of Maine's Washington and Hancock Counties. This area is known for its blueberry barrens, rugged granite coastline and unspoiled New England character. It is just inland from the coast and provides the visitor with an alternative to busy Route 1. This route has outstanding viewsheds of mountainous terrain with exposed granite ledges. Many scenic, historical, and recreational turnouts entice the visitor to linger along the drive. Turnouts may also have trailheads to numerous lakes and ponds along the byway corridor.
