<h4>A Wilderness Escape</h4>
<p>As a side road into the Uwharrie National Forest, the Birkhead
Wilderness Route reveals the most rugged areas of North Carolina's
piedmont.</p>
<p>This mountainous area offers travelers a view of wilderness
terrain combined with remnants of the past. Upon hiking the trails
of the area, visitors will catch glimpses of the past in the old
abandoned homesteads and mining areas.</p>
<p>The Uwharrie National Forest covers 4,800 acres where visitors
can see the oldest mountains on the continent. The byway travels
through some of the most sparsely populated areas of the state and
offers travelers a true escape from the bustle of urban life.</p>
