Pass corn fields, native grasses, wildflowers and the Shooting
Star Recreational Trail when driving along the Shooting Star Scenic
Byway in the Historic Prairie Country of Minnesota. The towns of
Adams, Rose Creek, Taopi, and LeRoy combine to give this byway a
small town touch. These communities combine with the natural beauty
of the prairie and the unique wildflowers for which this byway is
named.  

The route passes through rich agricultural regions and small
rural towns with historic buildings of national significance, bed
and breakfasts, golf courses, swimming pools and city parks. Lake
Louise State Park is also located on this route, offering visitors
and residents alike with multiple opportunities to enjoy the
Minnesota Prairie.  

This official Minnesota Scenic Byway is one of the state&#8217;s
first designated wildflower routes. The Minnesota Department of
Transportation and Natural Resources collaborate to manage
wildflowers and native grasses along the route.
