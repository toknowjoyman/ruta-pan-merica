Beach Boulevard Scenic Byway runs along the Hancock County coastline for 11.8 miles from the Cedar Point boat ramp on the north end to Cadet Bayou Harbor on the southern end. When you drive the byway, you'll see a range of national and state landmarks including historic buildings and districts. Stop at one of several piers that jut out from the boulevard or at the byway's many birding sites. Or stretch your legs on the trails or play disk golf at Buccaneer State Park. As you drive by, take a look at the construction site of the Bay St. Louis Harbor, which is set to be completed in 2013. The completed harbor will offer travelers a place to stop along their way and enjoy an extended recreational beach, the harbor, and the pier.
