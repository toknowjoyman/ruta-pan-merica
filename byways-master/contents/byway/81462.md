Offering extensive views of valleys, woodlands, farmlands, mountains, and rivers, the US 421 Scenic Byway travels through the Blue Ridge Mountains and ends at the South Fork of New River, which is thought to be one of the worldâ€™s first rivers and is an excellent place to canoe or fish. The byway also nears the town of Deep Gap, home of Appalachian musician Doc Watson. A number of Christmas Tree farms line the byway, along with hardwood and mixed forests and cattle and horse farms.
