The Averasboro Battlefield Scenic Byway allows travelers to follow the route of Civil War General William T. Sherman’s march through the Cape Fear River Valley. The byway also served as an important part of the early 1800s' plank road system and is dotted by small farms, patches of woodland, and historical markers that share the tale of the efforts of Southern troops to stop Sherman’s advance on the Averasboro community. View a re-creation of the original trench lines, visit the Chicora Civil War Cemetery and a restored slave cabin on the Smith Plantation, or spend some time exploring the Averasboro Battlefield Museum.
