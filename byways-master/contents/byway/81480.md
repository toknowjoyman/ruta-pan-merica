Travelers on Holo Holo Koloa Scenic Byway will enter one of the island of Kauai’s premier visitor destinations through a magnificent tree covered tunnel and proceed through a quaint town rich in local history. Traveling further south to the coast, one will view the many indigenous Hawaiian cultural sites including _heiau_, fishponds, footpaths, and remnants of a complex agricultural field system. The area incorporates the rich cultural tapestry of ancient and recent patterns of immigration, land use, and industrialization including the history of Koloa’s sugar production.
