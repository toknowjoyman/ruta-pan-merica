Cliff Drive has the distinction of being the only Missouri
scenic byway located in an urban area. The corridor passes right
through Kansas City, in scenic and historic George E. Kessler Park.
The drive is significant for its historic and natural
qualities.  

<div><em>Historical Urban Design</em></div>

Cliff Drive represents a fine example of historic urban design. The
design and planning effort of the byway is known worldwide.
Additionally, Cliff Drive and the surrounding park were uniquely
integral to the evolution and development of Kansas City as a major
metropolitan area.<br>
<br>
<div><em>Natural Wonders in the Big City</em></div>
Cliff Drive preserves natural features unique to this portion of
the Missouri River Valley. Some of these features include limestone
bluffs, natural vegetation, and wildlife. These features are
particularly unusual because they are located immediately adjacent
to the city core, within a heavily urbanized environment.
