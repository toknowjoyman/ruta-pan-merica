This level farming region unfolds an array of cross-tipped churches, all of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Three are highlighted below:  
<ul>
<li><strong>St. Augustine Church</strong>, built in 1848, is one of the area's oldest churches. As a highly esteemed place of worship, it has undergone many renovations. One such renovation was the addition of its impressive twin spires in 1874.</li>
<li>In 1862, New England settlers built the <strong>First Presbyterian Church</strong> in Wapakoneta. This church was built using a Greek Revival style, unlike other churches on the byway.</li>
<li>Another unique church is <strong>St. Joseph's Catholic Church</strong>, which happens to sit just south of First Presbyterian. This building employs the rounded arches of the Romanesque Revival style.</li>
</ul>
The route features other sorts of history, as seen in part by Fort Recovery, the National Marian Shrine of the Holy Relics, and the New Knoxville Historical Museum.  

Or for a little fresh air visit the Miami-Erie Canal Towpath -- a beautiful 3.5-mile hiking trail from St. Marys Memorial Park to Forty Acre Pond.
