This State Scenic Highway takes the traveler from the beautiful Salinas River to the spectacular California coast near Monterey.  Those journeying on the road will view parts of verdant Carmel Valley further inland, as well as the wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean stretching out as far to the west as the eye can see, all the while enjoying the beautiful oak, sycamore and pine trees sheltering the road.
