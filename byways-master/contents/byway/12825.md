<p>Journey this byway to historic and archaeological areas relating
to American Indian culture. The road travels through some of North
Carolina's quiet towns providing a scenic drive with a few pleasant
stops. Travelers will drive through peach country where they may be
enticed to stop at a roadside fruitstand for some fresh, plump
peaches.</p>
<p>The byway begins the Uwharrie Lakes area in the little town of
Ellerbe. Ellerbe was named for W.T. Ellerbe who developed Ellerbe
Springs further along the byway. The springs are home to the
Historic Ellerbe Springs Inn and Restaurant where some visitors may
want to dine and stay for a while to fully enjoy the
surroundings.</p>
<p>At the end of the byway, traveler's will find the route's
namesake. The Town Creek Indian Mound offers an in depth look at
one of the oldest cultures ever to inhabit the lands of North
Carolina. The Creek Indians of the Pee Dee peoples built mounds and
had ceremonies here nearly 400 years ago. Tour the reconstructed
temples and learn more.</p>
