<p>The White River Scenic Road was designated on May 13, 1992, by the Arizona Department of Transportation. This route follows the White River as it travels north to the Mogollon Rim. The entire route is located within the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. The Kinishba Ruins, west of Fort Apache on S.R. 73, is among the best examples of the prehistoric Mogollon culture found in Arizona. This route combines the mystery of its Indian heritage with the scenic beauty of the high country forests.</p>
