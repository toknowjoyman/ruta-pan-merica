The Lost Gold Trails Loop ventures off the Fort Henry Historic
Byway at the "Y" Junction onto County Road A-2. The loop then
travels southwest along the desert-lava rolling hill terrain where cattle and wild game peacefully share the spring and fall months grazing.

Crossing the railroad, which originated the town of "Dry Creek," now Dubois, and traveling west through town over I-15 overpass on Idaho 22, you connect with Old Highway 91.

Turn north on Old Highway 91 and head to Spencer, passing near the
US Sheep Experiment Station. This early-day Gold Trail closely
follows Beaver Creek towards the Montana gold mines.

At Spencer the Gold Trail of yesterday becomes the Opal Trails
of today and passes several high grade Opal Shops within the
original Wood Live Stock town site.

Leaving Spencer, the trail heads east to Idmon. This early day
Nez Perce Trail has spurs off its main roadway to private opal
mines, Caribou-Targhee Forest fishing and primitive camping areas, and an old cemetery, connecting again to the Fort Henry Historic Byway at the old Idmon town site.
