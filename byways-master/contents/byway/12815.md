<p>Take a drive that winds by the monarch of the mountains.
Crowders Mountain Drive, named for one of the early settlers passes
a scenic three-mile mountain range and through Crowders Mountain
State Park.</p>
<p>Among the peaks in the mountain range is one called the
Pinnacle. It is known as a <dfn>monadnock</dfn>, which is a
geological feature made from a mass of rock that has resisted
erosion. Because of this phenomenon, the Pinnacle towers high above
the rest of the peaks like a king.</p>
<p>Because the byway goes through a mountainous area, visitors may
want to experience rock climbing or hiking in the region. This
short byway is well worth the twenty minutes drive.</p>
